#' List of known ligands, receptors and their iteractions.
#'
#' This is a curated list of ligands, receptors and their potential interactions.

#' potential lists that could be used in place of or in addition to this list.
#' Notably, the CellPhoneDB (https://github.com/ventolab/CellphoneDB) package
#' has an extensively curated list including multiple receptor components.
